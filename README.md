Raspberry PI internet radio
Audiotron Version

This is a fork fron Bob Rathbone's excellent Pi Internet Radio hacked into the Voyetra Turtle Beach Audiotron. [http://www.bobrathbone.com/raspberrypi_radio.htm]

Audiotron files are in the contributors/Audiotron directory. Copy everything in that directory to the root of your installation ( It should be /home/pi/radio ), and adjust the init.d script to run 'radiotron.py'. This can also be run from command line if you are developing/testing. Information on hardware can be found at http://forum.javatron.org, and in the yahoo group 'Audiotron'

This is currently a work-in-progress.
